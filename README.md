**Introduction**	

Our project is a one-player game situated in an aquarium, in which the player controls/moves a turtle through a series of key interactions. The goal is to eat as many little fish as possible to earn "sand dollars" (points) to decorate the aquarium while avoiding the sharks. The more fish the player eats, the more sand dollars they have to buy accessories which are displayed on the menu bar on top. The turtle has three lives and each time it is "eaten", the turtle loses one life and the sharks will spawn faster.
