**Introduction/Overview:**	

Our project is a one-player game situated in an aquarium, in which the player controls/moves a turtle through a series of key interactions. The goal is to eat as many little fish as possible without getting eaten by a shark, hence the player must navigate to find little fish while avoiding sharks. The more fish the player eats, the higher the score they will have accumulated. The playerâ€™s turtle will also grow bigger each time it consumes a little fish, which will make it more and more difficult to dodge the sharks overtime. Once the player is eaten by a shark, the game is over. 
 
**Features:**

User Interaction (Moving): the player will be able to move the turtle up, down, left, and right to either consume fish or dodge a shark 

Collision Detection: The first instance of collision detention will be once our turtle reaches its prey. The little fish will disappear off the screen and our fish will be scaled bigger in size. The second instance of collision detection is when a shark touches the perimeter of our turtle. In this case, the game is over and the player is notified. 

Dynamic Object instantiation: As the game progresses and our turtle becomes bigger, more sharks will be spawned at faster speeds
